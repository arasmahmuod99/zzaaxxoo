            <h1>Zakho</h1>
            <p>Zakho is an Iraqi city and the center of the Zakho district in Dohuk Governorate,
                Iraqi Kurdistan. It is located near the northern border with Turkey,
                and the Khabur River passes through the city.
                Its population is a mixture of Muslim Kurds,
                and they constitute the majority of the population of the city of Zakho,
                with some Christians who are divided into Chaldean Catholics, Syriac Orthodox 
                and Armenians. It contains the Great Mosque of Zakho, which was built after
                the Islamic conquest of Iraq in 20 AH / 641 AD, and there are many archaeological
                monuments. The Dalal (Abbasid) Bridge is one of the most prominent historical
                landmarks of the city, which is still a witness to architecture in the Abbasid
                era, and there is also a statue in the city of the Kurdish fighter 
                Saleh al-Yousifi. . It overlooks the city of Zakho, Mount Bikhair,
                around which there are many stories about the flood of the Prophet Noah,
                and from the areas belonging to the Zakho district, the district of Barhim Khalil, and Darkar.
            </p>
            <h1>Labele</h1>
            <p>Historians differed in determining a specific date for the city or knowing
             the true meaning of its name. Jamal Baban mentions when mentioning Mount Zakho
             Tagh that it is attributed to the city of Zakho, which was written in the past 
             as the ancient Azukhis. It is inferred from this that the city had existed with 
             evidence of how the name of a city is called a mountain. He goes on to say that 
             The word Zakho means strength and determination in the Kurdish language, and he 
             adds that there is an opinion according to which Zacharius, one of the leaders 
             of Zenfon, put his travel stick during the retreat at the site of the town of Zakho
             , and the city was named after him. As for the explorer Konrad Breuser,
             when he came to Zakho, he said: We found ourselves in front of the island of Zakho,
             which is located on a rocky ground, similar to what we saw in the plain.
             It means (sand) found on the beaches, and the same term is still used by the people,
             and the name Khizi Duavi is still used on one of the northern regions of
             the central island. The most convincing local name is the presence of an area
             in the south of the city called by several names, including Khok. There is a
             stream flowing from the valley called Ziyi, and it was an important area in
             terms of the passage of the ancient trade route, the East Tigris Road, from it.
             It was taken from the caravans passing through there, called Khuk or Khik. 
             Perhaps the name Zakho means (Zi Khoen), meaning the river of blood, 
             in reference to a bloody accident that occurred in this place and blood 
             was spilled. There are those who trace the origin of the name to the Syriac 
             Aramaic word ܙܟܘܬܐ Zakhotha, which means “victory.” This name is traditionally 
             attributed to the victory of Alexander the Great over the Parthians in an area near Zakho.
