            <h1>History of Zakho</h1>
            <p>History of Zakho In the early days of Islam, the city expanded to the south to the
                current Al-Hussainiya locality and was called (Hasiniya Al-Khabur). It was mentioned
                by the Arab poet Abu Al-Ala Al-Ma'ari and the famous Venetian traveler Marco Polo. 
                The Hassaniya Al-Khabur was destroyed by the Turkish Al-Ghaz tribes in 1041 AD and
                later rebuilt in the central island, which became the nucleus of the city The current. 
                Then it became an independent emirate in the name of the Emirate of Sindia. When the 
                emirate weakened, the Badinan princes were able to annex it to their emirate in 1470 AD. 
                Then the city was under the control of the Ottomans and Zakho became a district in 1864. 
                In the year 1918 the British forces entered the city and practically ended the Ottoman 
                control over it and then the city was annexed The Kingdom of Iraq. Successive rulers who 
                took power in Iraq in the royal and republican eras visited the city because it was an 
                important strategic center for Iraq.
            </p>
            <h1>Zakho during the rule of the Badinan Emirate</h1>
            <p>
                The Ottomans divided Iraq in the sixteenth century into five states, including the Wilayat
                of Mosul, which was divided into sanjaks during the reign of Sultan Suleiman the 
                <li class="li1">Magnificent, and the Wilayat of Mosul was divided into five sanjaks.</li>
                <li class="li1">ascii Mosul</li>
                <li class="li1">Tikrit</li>
                <li class="li1">Zakho</li>
                <li class="li1">affliction</li>
                <li class="li1"> searchlight</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                After Zakho fell under the control of the Ottomans in 1515 AD, it gained a new status 
                and became a sanjak, i.e. a general within the state of Diyarbakir. Later Ottoman 
                documents in the sixteenth century indicate that it became a sanjak within the Wilayat 
                of Mosul, and its status continued as such in the second half of the sixteenth century. 
                It seems that it returned after that. It became a vassal of the Badinan Emirate, and the 
                city was ruled by a number of princes during that period. In the middle of September of 
                the year 1743 AD, Nader Shah sent a force towards the island of Bhutan. These forces 
                destroyed the villages located between Alqosh and Zakho, and the city was sabotaged 
                by Nadershah's forces. As soon as the crisis of the Ottoman Empire ended With the 
                governor of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha, in 1840, the Ottoman Empire turned its 
                attention to the Emirate of Badinan, and waged war on it until it was eliminated 
                in 1843.
            </p>
            <h1>History of Zakho after the fall of the Badinian Emirate</h1>
            <p>
                After the elimination of the Emirate of Badinan, the Ottoman rule remained fragile
                in the city. For this reason, the Ottoman authorities relied on some religious 
                families, who were easily criticized by the people out of respect for their religious 
                positions. The Naqshbandi Order The Zakhoyi were gentle, calm, daring in confronting 
                injustice, and a good administrator who was respected by people. There is no specific 
                and proven date for Sheikh Yusuf Al-Zakhoyi to assume the rule in the city, but it is 
                believed that his assumption was after the fall of the Badinani Emirate after the year
                1843. Sheikh Yusuf Al-Zakhoyi made an alliance with the Badrakhanians in what was 
                <li class="li1">known as the Holy Pact, and one of the most important provisions of this alliance is</li>
                <li class="li1">Carrying out a Kurdish uprising in the face of the Ottoman rule of the region</li>
                <li class="li1">Formation of an independent Kurdish force </li>
                <li class="li1">Determine the areas to be governed by each prince organized to the alliance</li>
                <li class="li1">Interest in fortifying existing castles and restoring ruined castles </li>
                <li class="li1"> Members of the Alliance must help each other in the event that one of them is exposed to external danger</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                
                Sheikh Youssef Al-Zakhoy was subjected to a coup-like and was imprisoned in Zakho, 
                without anyone knowing his whereabouts, and that was in the year 1847, that is, 
                after the fall of the Badrakhanian Emirate. Sheikh Youssef Al-Zakhoyi managed to 
                escape with the help of the people of the city.

                strengthened in various places in the mountains surrounding the city and on the night of 10-11/9 and after midnight 
                the control was achieved On the city on 9/20 the Iraqi forces began attacking Zakho in order to regain control of it.

                fell over the city sky, and the commander of the warplane landed safely in Al-Nasara neighborhood (one of the neighborhoods 
                of Zakho) and its wreckage was scattered on the outskirts of the city, but the real reason for the fall of that war plane

                of President Abdel Rahman Aref, solutions to the Kurdish issue began to appear on the horizon with the beginning of the new 
                era. This led to the announcement of March 11, the historic March 11 statement. In 1970, a spontaneous demonstration took

                1,000 fils per square meter. The efforts of a group of intellectuals resulted in forming an association for building housing 
                in Zakho in 1972, and they were able to obtain plots of land for the construction of housing on them. In the year 1986, the

                Wednesday, January 30, reassurance returned to the people of Zakho, especially after the Iraqi ambassador to 
                Turkey confirmed that the Iraqi government does not intend at all to respond to the coming raids by the coalition 
                forces launched through the territory of Turkey, and in the evening of that day at 10:50 an earthquake struck the 
                city of Zakho For four seconds, but no damage occurred. On February 28, 1991, US President George Bush Sr.
